### Usage

Tinaweb is a versatile app that can be used as standalone or as a client library. The documentation concerning the different setup cases is being updated after a major refactoring and will grow in time.

Here are the main points.

###### Getting started
In the simplest setup, just clone the repository and open explorerjs.html in a modern browser.
```
git clone git@github.com:ISCPIF/tinaweb.git
cd tinaweb
firefox explorerjs.html
```
=> An input in the upper right side allows you to open any gexf file.

###### Application and data structures
An overview of the application structure can be found in the extended documentation under [00.DOCUMENTATION/A-Introduction/app_structure.md](https://github.com/ISCPIF/tinaweb/blob/master/00.DOCUMENTATION/A-Introduction/app_structure.md) (comments are in french).

###### Usage on a web server
To activate all features, you should:
  1. configure a web server like apache or nginx, for instance on your localhost
  2. define a new "location" in your apache or nginx conf, pointing to the directory you cloned


Now you can already use ProjectExplorer as a showcase for a given file
  - Put a mono or bipartite gexf, e.g.: `Somemap.gexf`, inside the `data/` folder.
  - And then see it in your browser:  
        http://localhost/explorerjs.html?sourcemode=serverfile&file=data/Somemap.gexf

Once you have this webserver running and some source data files, you may also configure a "sources list":
  - it will be shown as a **menu** to select graphs in the interface
  - it allows to define associated **node types** for each source
  - it allows to define associated **search backends** for each source
  - to use this, follow the guidelines in the **[Project config HOWTO](https://github.com/ISCPIF/tinaweb/blob/master/00.DOCUMENTATION/A-Introduction/project_config.md)**

###### Integration in a larger app
To integrate ProjectExplorer in a larger web application, you may have several locations with subdirectories defined on your server. In this case, you'll need to use the provided path modification tool (see this [integration procedure example](https://github.com/ISCPIF/tinaweb/tree/master/00.DOCUMENTATION/A-Introduction#integration-policy))

###### Advanced settings
For more information about ProjectExplorer's settings (settings file, input modes, attribute processing options), please refer to the [detailed introduction](https://github.com/ISCPIF/tinaweb/blob/master/00.DOCUMENTATION/A-Introduction/README.md)
 and the [developer's manual](https://github.com/ISCPIF/tinaweb/blob/master/00.DOCUMENTATION/C-advanced/developer_manual.md).
